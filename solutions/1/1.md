# Context

* All the Process to Process communication are isolated and the option to read mem of other process is to be a part of process or IPC calls

* But for prod, changing your codebase to support checkpointing doesn't align well with our goal. 

However
* `The only solution we have right now is intercept the api call and  linking the module at start so process memory can be read` 


# Workarea

* GPU memory aren't exposed from Drivers API Calls, the only option is to intercept/listen the System API Calls

* While listening the most important is init `malloc` to know the memory location of process

* If it was CPU, kernels with root access dumps the memory in `/proc` but GPU are hardwired for isolations



# Solution at STEP !

* Use `LD_PRELOAD`, import it to a LLM inference/train code, access the memory location, its parameters and gradients/optimizer states

* Intercept the API Call made by the application model and find out the location of `malloc`



# Blockers


### FOR GPU Failback, 
what matters is


* KV Cache
* RNG
* Token Position
